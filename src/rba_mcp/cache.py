"""SQLite-backed HTTP cache with per-read TTL.

Single table; the same row can satisfy different TTL windows because TTL is
evaluated at read time. The `kind` column lets us run targeted invalidation
later without renaming.

Ported from abs-mcp 0.2.8 — only differences:
- DEFAULT_DB_PATH points at ~/.rba-mcp/
- CacheKind enum reduced to {"data", "latest"} (no SDMX catalogue/datastructure)
- Default TTLs tuned for RBA's daily-CDN refresh cadence
